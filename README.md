# Random Password Generator

I just switched from Chrome to Brave cause of all of the [manifest v2](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/chromes-manifest-v3-and-its-changes-for-ad-blocking-are-coming-real-soon/) stuff and it's been great. however, I miss the password generator that Chrome has built-in. I could've used another extension like 1Password or something, but can I really trust that blackbox? No.

Yes, I know I could've looked into the source code of the extension, but I thought _no_. So I wrote my own password generator. It's not perfect, but it's good enough for me. And I know how it works, so I can tweak it to my liking, but more importantly, I can trust it.

Anyway, to install this extension, go to Brave Extensions and click on the "Load unpacked" button. Then, select the folder where you downloaded this repository. If you don't see load unpacked, you might need to enable Developer Mode in Brave Settings. Or, not. Y'know, choose your own adventure. Either way, here's what it looks like:
